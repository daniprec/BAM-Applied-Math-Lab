Simulate the Lorenz system and explore its sensitivity to initial conditions.

## Required

1. Implement the Lorenz ODE and simulate with Euler's method.
2. Plot the 3D trajectory.
3. Run two simulations with slightly different initial conditions and compare.

## Extra Mile (Optional)

- Try different parameter values $(s, r, b)$ and describe changes.
- Use a smaller $dt$ and compare trajectories.
