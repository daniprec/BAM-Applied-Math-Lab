Simulate the Couzin model and report your findings.

You can follow the guide here:

[Couzin Model](couzin.qmd){.btn .btn-primary}

## Required

1. Implement the Couzin rules and motion.
2. Implement an animation that shows the individuals moving. You can see an example in the [Vicsek animation](vicsek-animation.qmd){.btn .btn-primary} chapter.
3. Explore the parameter space and report your insights. Find the four collective dynamical behaviours described in the original paper [@couzin2002collective].

Upload the code and a short report (1-2 pages done in LaTeX) describing your findings to the course platform.

## Extra Mile (Optional)

- Add sliders to allow change parameters (of your choice) on real time
- Implement the model in 3D, following the original paper [@couzin2002collective]
