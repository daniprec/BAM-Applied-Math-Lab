In this session we study **collective motion**: how local alignment rules create global order. The main example is the Vicsek model, with optional predator interaction.

## Case Studies

[Vicsek Model](vicsek.qmd){.btn .btn-primary} [Assignment](assignment.qmd){.btn .btn-secondary}

## What do we need?

### `matplotlib.pyplot`

Initialize the figure and axes and draw static elements.

### `matplotlib.animation`

Update plot elements in real time for animations.

### `matplotlib.Slider`

Add sliders so users can interact with parameters.

### `matplotlib.backend_bases`

Track mouse position and clicks for interactive behavior.

### Why not use `scipy.solve_ivp` here?

In previous sessions, we used ODE solvers like `scipy.solve_ivp` to study continuous-time dynamical systems. The Vicsek model, however, is fundamentally a discrete-time, agent-based model: at each step, all particles update their direction and position based on their neighbors and some noise. This update is not described by a differential equation, but by a set of rules applied at each time step. Therefore, we implement the Vicsek model using a simple loop, not an ODE solver.

This explorable illustrates of an intuitive dynamic model for collective motion (swarming) in animal groups. The model can be used to describe collective behavior observed in schooling fish or flocking birds, for example. The details of the model are described in [@couzin2002collective].
