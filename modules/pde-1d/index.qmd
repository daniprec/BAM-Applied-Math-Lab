In this session we move from ODEs to **reaction-diffusion PDEs** in one spatial dimension. We will discretize space with finite differences, advance in time with Euler's method, and visualize pattern formation.

## Case Studies

[Gierer-Meinhardt 1D](gierer-meinhardt.qmd){.btn .btn-primary} [Turing Instability](turing-instability.qmd){.btn .btn-primary} [Assignment](assignment.qmd){.btn .btn-secondary}

## Goals

- Implement the 1D Laplacian with finite differences.
- Simulate a reaction-diffusion system with explicit time stepping.
- Visualize patterns and understand when they emerge.
- Connect parameter choices to stability and pattern formation.
- Build animations and add simple user interaction.

## What do we need?

### `numpy`

We use NumPy arrays to represent spatial fields and `np.roll()` to compute the discrete Laplacian.

### `matplotlib.pyplot`

Initialize the figure and axes and plot static elements (labels, titles, limits).

### `matplotlib.animation`

Update line objects frame-by-frame to create animations.

### `matplotlib.backend_bases`

Handle mouse clicks to let the user interact with the simulation.

### `scipy`

Great for ODEs, but we will **not** use it for PDEs in this session. We need to enforce boundary conditions at every step.
