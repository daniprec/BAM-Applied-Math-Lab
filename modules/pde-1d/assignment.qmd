Implement a full 1D reaction-diffusion workflow for the **Gierer-Meinhardt model**. Your submission should include code and figures that demonstrate pattern formation.

## Required

1. Implement the PDE solver using an explicit Euler time step.
2. Enforce **Neumann** boundary conditions at each step.
3. Use $L=40$, $dx=0.5$, $dt=0.001$, $a=0.40$, $b=1.00$, $d=20$, $\gamma=1$.
4. Create an animation of $v(x)$ that updates in time.

## Turing Instability

5. Implement `is_turing_instability(a, b, d)` and plot the Turing space diagram.
6. Mark the point $(a, d)$ you are using on the diagram.

## Extra Mile (Optional)

- Compute unstable spatial modes and display the leading mode on the animation.
- Make the diagram interactive: clicking on $(a, d)$ updates the simulation.
- Try other boundary conditions and compare.

## Tips for Success

- **Start simple:** Verify your Laplacian and boundary conditions first.
- **Test incrementally:** Plot intermediate results to detect instability early.
- **Be careful with dt:** If the simulation explodes, reduce $dt$ or increase $dx$.
- **Document choices:** Report the parameters you used and the patterns you observed.
