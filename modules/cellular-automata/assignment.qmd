Complete a 1D cellular automaton and a traffic model simulation.

## Required

1. Implement Rule 30 and plot a space-time diagram.
2. Modify the initial row (at least 3 different initial conditions).
3. Implement the traffic CA and generate a space-time diagram.
4. Compare two densities and discuss the patterns.

## Extra Mile (Optional)

- Implement another rule (e.g., Rule 110).
- Add interactivity to the traffic model (sliders for density or $p$).
