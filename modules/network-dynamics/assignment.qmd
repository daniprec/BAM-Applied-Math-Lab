Implement the SIS model and explore its behavior.

## Required

1. Simulate SIS on a graph with 20 nodes.
2. Use at least two different network types (random, Watts-Strogatz, or Barabasi-Albert).
3. Plot the time evolution of S and I.
4. Try two sets of $(\beta, \gamma)$ and compare outcomes.

## Extra Mile (Optional)

- Extend to SIR or SIRS.
- Add a stop condition when infections die out.
- Visualize the network at different time steps.

Simulate the Daley-Kendall model on a real graph.

## Required

1. Load the Facebook network and run the simulation.
2. Use $\beta=0.2$ and $\gamma=0.1$ as a starting point.
3. Plot the time evolution of I, S, R.
4. Report how long it takes for the rumor to die out.

## Extra Mile (Optional)

- Add key press controls and sliders.
- Compare outcomes for two different initial spreaders.
- Remove a high-centrality node and analyze the effect.
