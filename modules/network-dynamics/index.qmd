In this session we implement a simple SIS model on a network. Nodes switch between Susceptible (S) and Infected (I).

## Case Studies

[SIS Model](sis.qmd){.btn .btn-primary} [Assignment](assignment.qmd){.btn .btn-secondary}

## What do we need?

### `networkx`

Create graphs and store node states.

### `matplotlib.pyplot`

Draw graphs and plot time series of S and I.
