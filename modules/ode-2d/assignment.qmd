You will build a Matplotlib animation for **one** 2D ODE model.

Choose a model

- [Van der Pol](./van-der-pol.qmd)
- [FitzHugh–Nagumo](./fitzhugh-nagumo.qmd)

Write **one** Python script that, when executed, opens a figure showing:

- the **nullclines**
- the **equilibrium point**, telling whether it's stable or unstable
- an **animated trajectory** in the phase plane (line + moving point)

Use the pipeline showed for the [CDIMA model](./cdima.qmd) as a starting point, and adapt it to the model you choose. For the animation, follow the steps outlined in [the animation page](./animation.qmd).

Then, add a second subplot that animates the time evolution of one variable (as indicated in the page for each model).

**Extra Mile (Optional):** Make the figure interactive: clicking on the phase plane sets the initial condition, and the animation restarts.

## Tips for Success

- **Start simple:** Get the ODE function working first, then build up.
- **Test incrementally:** Verify each function works before moving to the next.
- **Use the reference:** The provided code (and additional documentation) is there to help you understand the structure.
- **Experiment:** Try different parameter values and see what happens.
- **Collaborate:** Discuss with your teammates, divide the work if needed. You can also work separately and then compare your implementations.
- **Ask questions:** If you're stuck, ask for help!
