You will build a Matplotlib animation for **one** 2D ODE model.

Choose a model

- [Van der Pol](./van-der-pol.qmd)
- [FitzHugh–Nagumo](./fitzhugh-nagumo.qmd)

Write **one** Python script that, when executed, opens a figure showing:

- the **nullclines**
- the **fixed point**
- an **animated trajectory** in the phase plane (line + moving point)

Use the pipeline showed for the [CDIMA model](./cdima.qmd) as a starting point, and adapt it to the model you choose. For the animation, follow the steps outlined in [the animation page](./animation.qmd).

Then, add a second subplot that animates the time evolution of one variable (as indicated in the page for each model).

**Extra Mile (Optional):** Make the figure interactive: clicking on the phase plane sets the initial condition, and the animation restarts.
