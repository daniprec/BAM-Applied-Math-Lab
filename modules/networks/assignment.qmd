Pick **one** dataset (USA Flights or Enron) and complete the tasks below.

## Required

1. Load the graph with NetworkX and report nodes/edges.
2. Compute and list the top 10 nodes by degree centrality.
3. Compute one additional metric (betweenness, clustering, or PageRank).
4. Visualize the graph (full or sampled) and include a short interpretation.

## Extra Mile (Optional)

- Remove a high-centrality node and analyze changes in connectivity.
- Compare two different centrality metrics and discuss differences.
- Try a community detection method and summarize results.
