Complete the Kuramoto model workflow and report your findings.

## Required

1. Implement the Kuramoto ODE and animate oscillators on the unit circle.
2. Use $N=100$, $dt=0.01$, and $\sigma=1.0$. Show a screenshot of the unit-circle plot.
3. Identify a coupling strength $K$ where synchronization starts.

## Bifurcation Diagram

4. Draw the theoretical curve for $0 < K < 5$.
5. Overlay empirical points using $N=1000$, $dt=0.01$, $t=100$.
6. Explain why the theoretical curve fails if you use a normal distribution.

## Extra Mile (Optional)

- Implement the full simulation with sliders.
- Compare mean-field and pairwise coupling.
