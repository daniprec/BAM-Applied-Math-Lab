In this session we return to ODEs and study **coupled oscillators**. The main example is the Kuramoto model, where synchronization emerges from weak coupling.

## Case Studies

We will focus on the Kuramoto model, which represents a population of oscillators with distributed natural frequencies. The following button will guide you through a basic implementation of the model, including visualizations of the oscillators.

Next, we will explore the bifurcation diagram of the Kuramoto model, which shows how the order parameter changes as a function of the coupling strength.

Finally, we merge the two graphs together into a full simulation with sliders to control parameters in real time.

And once that is ready, we will apply the same ideas to a more complex system: the Millennium Bridge crowd–bridge synchrony model.

## What do we need?

### `scipy`

We are back to ODEs. Use `scipy.integrate.solve_ivp()`.

### `matplotlib.pyplot`

Initialize the figure and axes and draw static elements.

### `matplotlib.animation`

Update plot elements in real time for animations.

### `matplotlib.Slider`

Add sliders so users can interact with parameters.
