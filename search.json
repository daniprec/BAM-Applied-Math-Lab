The population dynamics can be modeled by the following ODE (Strogatz 2024, chap. 3.7):\n\\[\n\\frac{dx}{dt} = rx\\left(1 - \\frac{x}{k}\\right) - \\frac{x^2}{1 + x^2}\n\\]\nwhere:\n\n\\(x(t)\\) is the budworm population (adimensional).\n\\(r\\) is the intrinsic growth rate (typically \\(r \\approx 0.5\\)).\n\\(k\\) is the carrying capacity of the forest (typically \\(k \\approx 10\\)).\n\nThe first term represents logistic growth, while the second term models predation by birds (which follows a saturating functional response).",

    "text": "In Session 1 we studied 1D ODEs, where the geometry is simple: trajectories move along a line and equilibria are points where \\(\\dot x = 0\\). In 2D, the state is \\((x(t), y(t))\\) and trajectories live in the phase plane. This unlocks new qualitative behaviors: spirals, limit cycles, excitability, and relaxation oscillations.\nIn the course material, we will use several 2D models (CDIMA reaction, Van der Pol, FitzHugh–Nagumo). In this session we focus on the workflow:\n\nintegrate a system with scipy.integrate.solve_ivp\nvisualize trajectories in the phase plane\ncompute nullclines and fixed points\nanimate the trajectory with matplotlib.animation\nrestart the simulation interactively using mouse clicks\n\n\n\nBy the end of this session, you will be able to:\n\nImplement a 2D ODE in the signature expected by solve_ivp.\nCompute and plot phase-plane trajectories.\nCompute nullclines (analytically when possible, numerically otherwise).\nLocate fixed points using scipy.optimize.fsolve.\nCreate a Matplotlib animation that updates plot elements per frame.\nAdd an on-click event to change initial conditions/parameters and restart the animation.",
