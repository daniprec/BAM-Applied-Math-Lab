# BAM: APPLIED MATH LAB

Welcome to the Applied Math Lab! This repository contains the materials for the Applied Math Lab, a course offered by the [BAM](https://www.ie.edu/university/studies/academic-programs/bachelor-applied-mathematics/) program at IE University. The course is designed to introduce students to computational methods for solving problems in applied mathematics, with a focus on modeling and simulation. The course covers a range of topics, including ordinary differential equations, partial differential equations, agent-based modeling, network theory, and cellular automata.

## How to Use This Repository

To get started with this repository, follow these steps:

**Clone or Download**: Clone the repository using the command below, or download it as a ZIP file and extract it.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/daniprec/BAM-Applied-Math-Lab.git
```

**Create a Conda Environment**: It is recommended to create a new conda environment with the latest version of Python (as of now, Python 3.13).

```bash
conda create --name amlab python=3.13
conda activate amlab
```

**Install Required Packages**: Install the necessary packages listed in `requirements.txt`.

```bash
conda install --yes --file requirements.txt
```

Now you are all set up and ready to use the repository!

## Running Streamlit

Some scripts in this repository use Streamlit, a library included in the `requirements.txt` file. When you run a script with Streamlit, you might see the following warning:

```bash
Warning: to view this Streamlit app on a browser, run it with the following command:
```

To run Streamlit, follow these steps:

**Open Terminal**: Navigate to the directory containing your script.

**Run Streamlit**: Use the following command, replacing `<path-to-your-script>` with the path to your Streamlit script.

```bash
streamlit run <path-to-your-script>
```

This command will automatically open a new tab in your default web browser, displaying the Streamlit app.

If the browser does not open automatically, you can manually open it by navigating to the URL provided in the terminal output.
