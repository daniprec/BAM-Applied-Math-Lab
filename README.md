# BAM: APPLIED MATH LAB

Welcome to the Applied Math Lab! This repository contains the materials for the Applied Math Lab, a course offered by the [BAM](https://www.ie.edu/university/studies/academic-programs/bachelor-applied-mathematics/) program at IE University. The course is designed to introduce students to computational methods for solving problems in applied mathematics, with a focus on modeling and simulation. The course covers a range of topics, including ordinary differential equations, partial differential equations, agent-based modeling, network theory, and cellular automata.

## SESSION 1 (LIVE IN-PERSON)

- Excitable and oscillatory systems.
- Using Python for numerical integration to solve 1D systems of nonlinear ordinary differential equations (ODEs).
- Creating animations in Python to visualize system evolution.
- Building interactive Python programs with on-click events to set initial conditions.

## SESSION 2 (LIVE IN-PERSON)

- Using Python for numerical integration to solve 2D systems of nonlinear ordinary differential equations (ODEs).
- Creating animations in Python to visualize system evolution.
- Building interactive Python programs with on-click events to set initial conditions.

## SESSION 3 (LIVE IN-PERSON)

- Reaction-diffusion equations and pattern formation.
- Using Python for numerical integration of reaction-diffusion equations, based on a finite differences scheme.
